                We are Falkon Robotics, FRC team 589, with an enrollment of 115 students, we have 13 mentors, and 10 college age mentors in training. Almost half of those students have volunteered to mentor in FLL, an outreach program for younger engineers who we hope will be inspired by the actions of our team. We participate in FIRST Robotics Competition and share our passion for engineering with our community.

                Team 589 maintains a supportive culture through a second family approach. Through FLL programs and outreach events, FRC 589 inspires others, and in turn, facilitates self-insights. These activities help us grow our team and grow as a team, and encourages members of the community to be involved in STEAM. Our team collaborates with our mentors to further improve our technical capabilities, building on our solid foundations with innovative design features at appropriate risk levels.

                    If you own a business and you would be interested in conducting a fundraiser with CV Robotics, please contact our head mentor Lyn Repath-Martos at lyn@cvrobots.com. We will be more than happy to work out the terms of the fundraiser with you, according to your needs. The event would generally entail a "dine-out night", where a percentage of the day's proceeds would directly benefit CV Robotics. In turn, however, it will also benefit your business.

                    Donating helps our students achieve their goals. Our team of students builds a robot every year to compete in the FIRST Robotics Competition. Your money will be used to purchase robot parts for our competitions, fund our transportation and help us raise awareness about our program.
